Youtube-Embeder
===============

This will add an 'Load Embeding' Button to the top of your subscriptions and collections page. The button will create a button will replace description and view count with a button that will allow you to watch the videos in the embeded page.

Now with the YoutubeSubscriptions page you can view all the subs. Its not exactly the same project, but I have no where else to put this. and tbh, not very useful execpt in my particular scenario where the sub page isn't always availble.
